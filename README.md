# XamlMapControlSL
This is a branch from clemensF/XamlMapControl version 2.13 to be compatible with both WPF and silverlight.
The project should be open with visual studio 2015. visual studio 2017 does not support silverlight development anymore.

Though silverlight will not be supported by microsoft after 2021 (as stated by microsoft officially), the silverlight works well for most business internal systems, especially for rich interface architecture.

Note: It's incompatible with current version maintained by clemensFischer now: 
[https://github.com/ClemensFischer/XAML-Map-Control](https://github.com/ClemensFischer/XAML-Map-Control "ClemensFischer/XAML-Map-Control"). The current version from clemensFisher works only on core net, not on silverlight anymore.
